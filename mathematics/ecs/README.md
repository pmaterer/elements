# Entity Component Systems (ECS)

An ECS has the following characteristics:

* It has *entities*, which are unique identifiers.
* It has *components*, which are plain datatypes without behavior.
* Entities can contain zero or more components.
* Entities can change components dynamically.
* It has *systems*, which are functions matched with entities that have a certain set of components.
